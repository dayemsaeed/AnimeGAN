# AnimeGAN

A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) application using the StyleGAN2 model described in ![this](http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04958) paper to generate 2D anime character face models. The implementation also interpolates and transforms one face model to another. This can be used on any dataset of images. not just 2D characters.
